Our project aims to create an AI-powered platform that generates custom illustrations and icons in the distinctive Notion style. Designed for simplicity, clarity, and functionality, these illustrations and icons are ideal for enhancing productivity tools, digital planners, note-taking apps, and websites.

Using advanced AI algorithms, our platform will allow users to easily customize and generate unique Notion-inspired visuals tailored to their specific needs. The generated graphics will be available in scalable vector graphic (SVG) format, ensuring high-quality resolution for any application, from web design to print.

Whether you are a designer, developer, or content creator, our tool will provide an efficient way to create visually cohesive and aesthetically pleasing assets that align with Notion's minimalistic and modern design language.
